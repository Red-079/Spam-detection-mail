# Spam detection

## General info

The project concerns spam detection in SMS messages. We used text classification method to determined whether the messages is spam or not and NLP methods to prepare and clean our text data (tokenization, remove stop words, stemming). To get more accurate predictions we applied different machine learning classification algorithms like: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Gradient Boosting.

The dataset comes from SMS Spam Collection and can be find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).
